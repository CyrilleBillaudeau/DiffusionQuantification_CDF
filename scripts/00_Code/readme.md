This workflow has been divided into five steps:
1. Cell segmentation
2. Pre-processing of the time-lapse image sequences
3. Single particle tracking using TrackMate from [Fiji](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/).
4. MSD classification
5. CDF analysis

The outputs obtained after execution are saved by default in a folder named after the scripts.
