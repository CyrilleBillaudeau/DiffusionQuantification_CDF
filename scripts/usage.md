# Installation
Fiji and Matlab are required to run theses scripts. 
* Scripts for Fiji has been tested on version 2.16.0/1.54p but should works on other version (despite I didn't checked). Few plugins are required to run the scripts: [ImageScience](https://imagej.net/libs/imagescience) (for FeatureJ), 
[MorphoLibJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/morpholibj) and [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/)
* Scripts for Matlab has been tested on Matlab R2024b

# Usage
1. Download all files to your computer without modifying the folder organisation.
2. Copy '00_Code' (and all the files inside it) into every folder containing raw acquisitions.
3. Run each script using either Fiji (steps 1–3) or Matlab (steps 4–5).
